        Once upon a time, in 2023, I was planning my trip to what was then called <a
          href="https://itrevolution.com/articles/introducing-enterprise-technology-leadership-summit/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">DevOps Enterprise Summit</a
        > in Vegas. I was looking at the map of the conference hotel when I saw something called
        Art-o-Mat. What the…
      </p>
      <p>
        I looked it up. <a href="https://www.artomat.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >Art-o-Mat</a
        >. Old style cigarette vending machines (the kind that used to be in bars, where you pull a
        knob and it goes ka-chunk and a cigarette box lands in the slot) converted to sell art. How
        cool is that?
      </p>
      <p>
        I had an idea for something I might be able to draw, so I applied, and they accepted me as
        an artist. Since then, I've drawn several hundred Mysterious Creatures for Art-o-Mat
        machines around the US.

        They are 2″ x 3″ watercolor paper cards, mounted on wooden blocks, with creature shapes
        drawn in black ink on top of colorful splashes of watercolor paint. I have fun
        experimenting with acrylic paints on the sides of the blocks, and I name each piece on the
        back.

          alt="Two 2 inch by 3 inch blocks standing on end. Each has the ends painted and a business card attached. The business card says: 'mysterious creatures 6, art by Jessica Roy, leaf@bouncingleaf.com, www.bouncingleaf.com. Listen closely and this creature may tell you their story, or your own.' The cards are numbered #11/50 and #12/50. Behind these blocks, a few more rows of similar blocks. Each block has a name; the ones most clearly visible are 'walking in shadows,' 'pendulum,' and 'bringing flame.'"

        I'm having fun drawing them, and they bring a little joy to a world that definitely needs
        more joy right now.
