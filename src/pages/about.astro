        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>
          My passion for process improvement and helping others be happy in their work lives has led
          me from working as a software developer, to being a tech lead and then an application
          architect. Now I'm writing a <a href="/book">book</a> to share my knowledge from 25+ years in
          tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          I completed my PMI-ACP certification – Agile Certified Practitioner, from the Project
          Management Institute. I'm a big fan of agile as a mindset.
        </p>

        <h2>Speaking</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a writer at heart, so I was surprised at first to discover that I love speaking too.
          But my writing skills let me guide an audience from where they are to somewhere new, and
          that's magical to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          When people approach me after a talk, they often use words like 'resonate,' 'real,' and
          'human.' They tell me that they felt seen. I love helping people find shared humanity
          within our world of technology.

        <h2>Why Leaf?</h2>
        <p>
          When I was in college, a <a
            href="https://www.instagram.com/jollyolsaintnicksandiego/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">friend</a
          > of mine called me by my email username (jroy, at the time). I said that was like calling me
          by my social security number. "If you're not going to call me by my right name, at least come
          up with a new name for me."
        </p>
        <p>Well, more than 30 years later, pretty much everyone who knows me calls me Leaf.</p>
