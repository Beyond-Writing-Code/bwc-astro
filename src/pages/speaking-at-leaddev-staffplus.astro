      <h2>Us vs. Them Talk & Slides</h2>

      <p>
        I was fortunate to speak on the StaffPlus stage! I spoke about my experiences with "Us vs.
        Them" thinking.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most common question I got after the talk was: "So, what happened next?!" Oops! I didn't
        mean for it to be a cliffhanger!
      </p>

      <p>
        As I was preparing my "recap" slides below, I realized that the talk stopped at the moment
        where I had learned the takeaway lesson. But there's more! I added an epilogue and some
        other Q&A below.
      </p>

      <h2>Book</h2>

      <p>
        As I mentioned during the talk, I'm writing a book on the "human" side of being a developer.

      <p>
        When you reach out, tell me about one of the other talks or events you liked best from the
        conference.
      </p>

      <p>I was also handing out cards and stickers…</p>

      <img
        src="/images/posts/2025/cardsStickers-1.jpg"
        alt="Two business cards and a small round sticker. One card says 'Beyond Writing Code Questions for reflection' and 'In what ways might slowing down actually help us to move faster?' The other card has a watercolor and ink drawing of a creature with a thought balloon that just has a question mark. The sticker has the same watercolor creature and the text 'Beyond Writing Code' and 'beyondwritingcode.com' around it."
        class="cards-image"
      />

      <p>
        If you drew a card, feel free to drop me a note on LinkedIn ("everyone's favorite social
        network!") to share your thoughts!
      </p>

      <p>I put the card questions online <a href="/card">here</a>.</p>
