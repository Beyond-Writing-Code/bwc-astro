      <p>
        Did you see me (Leaf) at a conference recently, and did you get a "questions for reflection"
        card from me? Or did you see a question posted online?
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm <a href="/">Leaf</a>, and I'm writing a <a href="/book">book</a> about the <em>human</em
        >
        side of being a developer. You can read more of my writing <a href="/posts">here</a>.
      </p>

      <img

        alt="Two business cards and a small round sticker. One card says 'Beyond Writing Code Questions for reflection' and 'In what ways might slowing down actually help us to move faster?' The other card has a watercolor and ink drawing of a creature with a thought balloon that just has a question mark. The sticker has the same watercolor creature and the text 'Beyond Writing Code' and 'beyondwritingcode.com' around it."

      </p>

      <p>Stickers, for sure. I love stickers. That was easy.</p>

        But when I saw{' '}

      <p>
        He offered people a deck of small cards, and I chose "Delete the code you don't want to see
        in the world" from the deck. Clever!
      </p>

      <p>
        I considered being a copycat, but I was struggling to come up with more than about three
        affirmations. Once I decided to make it "questions for reflection" instead, well… I thought
        of 50 pretty quickly, enough to make a full set.
      </p>

      <p>And then I thought of another 50.</p>

      <p>
        I ordered two versions: business card size, and sticker size. I used this{' '}
