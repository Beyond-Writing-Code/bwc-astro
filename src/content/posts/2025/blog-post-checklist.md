I have been importing blog posts from my previous blog at [Medium](https://bouncingleaf.medium.com/), and I keep losing track of the steps.

And often, when I want to document something for myself, it’s my habit to document it for anyone else who has the same question…

This is exactly what my blog post checklist will look like. I mean, the checklist below — not the ink-on-graph-paper. But graph paper’s cool too.

While writing the post

- Catchy but short title? (Sometimes I go for an entertainingly long title instead.)
- At least one interesting image?
- Caption your image(s)? Unsplash doesn’t require an attribution, but I like to add one.
- Got sub-headings?
- Review: brevity, passive voice

At the end of the post

- A short note to sum up
- If you’re importing from Medium, did you mention that? “Originally posted \[date\] on Medium.”
- Add the Medium link?
- Is it long enough that you kinda wanna add a second photo?

Metadata

(I’m using WordPress, the metadata is all the stuff on the right hand side under “Post”.)

- Set featured image?
- URL slug? (This one is “blog-post-checklist” which is okay)
- Discussion – open or closed?
- Categories?
- Tags?

Note

I wanted my posts to have a featured image that will appear on the [Posts](https://www.beyondwritingcode.com/posts/) page, but not appear twice in the article. However, barring any customization, setting a featured image that is already in my post will make it appear twice: once at the top where I don’t want it, and once where I put it.

Fortunately, I was able to figure that out:

1.  Appearance > Editor
2.  Click anywhere on the page to make the toolbar appear
3.  Click the black and white circle icon for Styles in the upper right
4.  Select the vertical “…” and choose Additional CSS
5.  Add the following, Save, and refresh your browser

```
.wp-block-post-featured-image {
display: none;
}
```

And so…

Here’s the aforementioned “short note to sum up.”

Did this checklist actually prove to be useful to anyone else other than me? Drop a note here if you used it.
