I’m not saying it’s time to go stare at the wall. Well, maybe I am.

Maybe you’ve been firefighting most of the day, one urgent situation after another popping up like ads on top of a recipe blog. Perhaps it’s been an endless stream of meetings. Or maybe you’ve been working heads-down for hours (lucky you!), writing code for some huge project. Whatever the situation, it’s now late in the day, you’re dragging… but you’re trying to get “just one more thing” done before you dash out the door.

First of all, is it just me, or is there always “just one more thing” immediately after that “one more thing” you’re working on? An endless stream of what seem at the time like final tasks, each one inspiring the need for the next…

Secondly, let’s take a good look at how _well_ you’re accomplishing that “one more thing.” Mmm hmm.

I can hear some of you now, saying, “Oh come on, I can _totally_ code for 13 hours straight! My code at 8pm is just as good as my code at 8am.” I hear it because I’ve said similar things in the past. And I’m not here to suggest that you’re wrong. I mean, you’re probably wrong. But who knows, maybe your ability to code for long hours is truly exceptional. 🏅

I am here to suggest that you start to learn the signals that tell you when you are simply Done Coding For The Day, regardless of what the clock says or how long you’ve been at it. In other words, learn how to recognize when you’ve hit a wall. Here are some warning signs to watch for.

# You’re forgetting stuff

You spend an hour debugging your code, only to find out that you’d assigned a variable the value `"INSERT_REAL_VALUE HERE"` instead of the correct value. You meant to go look up said real value and add it before committing that code. You forgot. Looking up the value takes you 20 seconds. Well, there’s an hour you won’t get back.

Or you send your boss an email about a spreadsheet, but you forget to attach the spreadsheet. You send a second email with the attachment, forgetting there are actually TWO spreadsheets you need to send. You send the second attachment. Two minutes later, you remember that you never added this morning’s data to the first spreadsheet…

# You’re making familiar mistakes

Even though I’ve been using mostly JavaScript for several years now, other languages I’ve used sometimes still make an unwanted guest appearance.

For example: when I, yet again, use `contains()` on an array in JavaScript. JavaScript, yet again, reminds me that it doesn’t know what I’m talking about. It’s `includes()` that I want, not `contains()`.

I have to look that up, _every time_. I had to look it up for this article. For me, the warning sign is not forgetting the function name. The warning sign is forgetting to _go look up_ the function name.

# You’re making newbie mistakes

If you’re a newbie, making newbie mistakes is normal! Nothing to see here. You can move on to the next section.

If you’ve been in this field a while, though, and you’re catching yourself using `=` (assignment) when you mean `===` (strict equals), for example… it might be time to step away from the keyboard.

# You’ve gone way off course

Your code worked fine at around 4pm. You were just trying to fix one little piece of one little unit test. Now it’s several hours later, and not only have you not fixed your unit test, you have broken your previously working code in a way you don’t understand. And in the course of trying to fix that, you accidentally changed something else, and now your application won’t even start on your branch. And in your flailing attempt to get the code on your branch to work, you inadvertently committed a bunch of code to an unrelated branch…

When you are so far down in the pit of despair, my friend: stop digging.

# You literally can’t see 😫

A comma where a semicolon ought to be. Missing quotation marks. A variable called `employeeFirstName` in one place and `employeeFirstname` 20 lines later. These things happen to us all now and then. But if “now and then” has turned into “three times in the past hour,” it’s time to give your eyes a rest.

# Better late than never

If you don’t catch yourself faltering in the moment, you might start to notice the results the next day. You can’t change the past, but this is still useful information for the future!

Pay attention when, in the light of day, you see that all of your code from last night stinks. Or worse, your peers reviews your late-night pull request, and point out at length exactly what stinks about your code. Even worse, most or all of it involves basic mistakes you know you wouldn’t normally make.

Water under the bridge, but start to connect a certain fuzzy-brained feeling on day 1 with the unpleasant results on day 2. You’ll begin to recognize what _might have been_ signs for you last time, and thereby learn what might be signs for you next time.

Regardless of whether you can make it through 13 hours straight of coding, or if you run out of steam much earlier than that, pay attention to what the warning signs are for you that things are going awry. You’ll save yourself a lot of stress by learning when it’s time for you to step back from the keyboard and go do something else — or go stare at the wall.[](https://medium.com/tag/self-care?source=post_page-----729ee0799e84---------------------------------------)
