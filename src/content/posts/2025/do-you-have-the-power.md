I was told once that I “should feel empowered” to influence strategy, something I had been blocked from doing in multiple ways.

This was not welcome news.

Feel empowered!

I could feel empowered all I wanted, but until I actually had the power, it wasn’t going to help. I also pointed out that it seemed like a setup to pin blame on me for not doing something I wasn’t actually allowed to do.

This wasn’t a matter of my having low self-esteem or a flawed sense of my own abilities. I had been learning the hard way in the months before this feedback that I had in fact vastly overestimated the power that my role held.

I had confidence in my abilities. The barriers to my getting things done weren’t in my mindset.

Thinking about it now, if I had actually felt empowered and tried to influence strategy any more than I did already, it would have brought me criticism for stepping out of my lane.

I’ve read suggestions for managers about empowering their teams. But if people actually have the power they need to get their jobs done, then they don’t need someone else “empowering” them.

And if your people don’t have the power they need, simply telling them to feel empowered doesn’t change that.

It may even be harmful. You might just be informing them that, if they don’t do the work they don’t have the power to do, you’ll blame them.

Instead, figure out what power that person needs, and make sure that’s inherent in their role.
