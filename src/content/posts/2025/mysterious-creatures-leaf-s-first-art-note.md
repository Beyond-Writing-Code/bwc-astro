_Beyond Writing Code - Art 1_

_June 27, 2025_

Overwhelmed? Too much email unread in your inbox? Good news: this one's mostly pictures.

I promised the occasional glimpse of my art...

I make art for [Art-o-mat](https://www.artomat.org/), which converts old cigarette vending machines to sell art. I draw mysterious creatures on 2" x 3" watercolor paper.

"looking for..."

I glue each drawing to a wooden block, paint the edges, and number and name each on the back

Mysterious Creatures series 6

I just sent Art-o-mat my ninth set of 50 pieces to distribute. I've drawn many more than that.

Why mysterious? Well... they do defy expectations at times:

"creature daydreaming in the sun"

This one is the logo for [beyondwritingcode.com](https://www.beyondwritingcode.com):

I know I should have a logo that represents my message or my brand, but I just love this little one sooo much

Look again at the creature above. How many legs and arms are there? Hmm... mysterious.

Want to say hello to more creatures? My art and personal site is [bouncingleaf.com](https://www.bouncingleaf.com).

"off I go"

## Art email

My current plan:

- Continue to send one email per week, generally on Tuesday, about software development, writing, the book, or whatever else
- Second email, maybe not weekly, later in the week, with art stuff. More pictures, less text.

If you're not into art email (or if you _only_ want art email?) you can [adjust your preferences here](https://preview.convertkit-mail2.com/preferences).

## Drop me a note

As always, I would love to hear from you. Hit reply and let me know what's on your mind.
