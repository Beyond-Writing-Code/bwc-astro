Beware of the scams targeting job seekers. I’d say “it’s a new low” for scammers to target people who are looking for work, but no, unfortunately… the scammers seem to reside at those depths.

## Scammers who aren’t who they claim to be

Beware these tactics for scammers trying to mask their true identity.

- **Text-only** interviews (no video call).
- **AI-generated video.** Some sophisticated scammers are using AI to make them look like someone they’re not.
- LinkedIn profiles or other online content may be **convincing fakes**. Or **hacked**.
- Scammers **impersonating legitimate people.** The name on the email is a real recruiter, but the actual sender is a scammer pretending to be the recruiter.

- **Lookalike URLs**, e.g., if the real site is companyname dot com, but the email is from companyname**inc** dot com.
- **Spoofed email**.
- Entirely **fake companies**.

## Scammers after a job seeker’s money

Don’t share your bank account information until you’re hired at a company you’re 100% sure is legitimate and you’re ready to get that paycheck by direct deposit! Even something that seems like it couldn’t be a scam, like accepting a check from the company as payment for something, has the potential to be a problem.

Watch out for these scams:

- **Requests for payment** or for your banking info, e.g. to cover “fees.” This includes payment for background checks or credit reports.
- **Exclusive paid content.** Would you pay extra to have the inside scoop on how to get hired at Google? That exclusive content may not be anything other than publicly shared information.
- **Money launderers**. Don’t take any jobs handling money for others unless you’re completely sure of their legitimacy. Scammers may be criminals trying to hide the trail of money they’ve stolen.
- Being **sent a check** e.g., for equipment or training. Even after you’ve been “hired”.
  - You buy a laptop, they send you a check for the amount, you send them the laptop “to be configured,” the check bounces and they disappear.
  - They “overpay” you and ask you to send some back. You send it back, but then their check bounces.

Wait, wouldn’t it be okay to accept a check and only act on it after it clears? No, **a cleared check isn’t proof that it hasn’t bounced**. From the FTC site on [fake check scams](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-report-fake-check-scams#Types):

> By law, banks have to make deposited funds available quickly. **Even if you see the funds in your account, that doesn’t mean it’s a good check.** Fake checks can take weeks to be discovered and untangled. By that time, the scammer has any money you sent, and you’re stuck paying the money back to the bank.

## Other red flags

- Sharing your **personal information too early** in the process (e.g., you shouldn’t need to share a social security number to start the conversation)
- Anything unusual they ask you to run on your own machine: custom software, a project with a github repository. These can be malware designed to steal your personal information.
- Job offers for roles **you didn’t apply** for.
- Salaries much better than you’d expect for the position.
- Be suspicious if you’re getting a lot of pressure from the company to do things quickly. They may be trying to keep you from doing proper research.
- Trust your intuition if something feels “off” or seems too good to be true.

## How to protect yourself

As a job seeker, what can you do to protect yourself from scams?

- If this isn’t a company you’re familiar with, see what you can learn about them. Sites like LinkedIn and Glassdoor might help, but they aren’t alone proof of a legitimate company.
- You could also ask friends if they are familiar with the company, or see if you have any second-degree contacts there on LinkedIn.
- Look for the company name + “scam” or “complaint” online.
- Verify via the company’s real website. Reach out to them rather than relying only on contact information given to you.
- When possible, meet someone in person.
- I’ve heard that, if you suspect AI-generated video, you can ask the person to put their hand in front of their face. Apparently, AI has a hard time handling that. I heard a story of one sketchy interviewer who refused to do this.

## Things you can do if scammed

What if a scammer contacted you? What if things went too far before you realized something was amiss?

- Freeze your account at all three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion). Freezing is free.
- Change your banking info, if you’ve given it out.
- If the scammer impersonated a real company, contact them via their website to report it.
- Report LinkedIn-based scams to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-RPS).
- Report it to the authorities. The police for your city or town might take a police report. See also:
  - The [Internet Crime Complaint Center](https://www.ic3.gov/)
  - The [Federal Trade Commission](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/)
  - Your state’s Attorney General
- Educate others.
- Beware additional scammers claiming they can help protect you, get your money back, etc.

And: don’t beat yourself up. The scammers are getting harder and harder to detect.

“Job seekers beware scams” was originally a post on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmroy/recent-activity/all/), but it seemed worthy of a permanent home on my website.
