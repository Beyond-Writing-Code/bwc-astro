_Beyond Writing Code #13_

_August 12, 2025_

People don't want more content. **We want one solution to one specific problem.**

That point from [this article](https://substack.com/@landonpoburan/p-166244806) by Landon Poburan caught my eye. As Landon said:

[![A quote from Landon Poburan's Substack article entitled What People Actually Want Isn't A Paid Newsletter. The quote: Creators assume customers think: For $5/month, I get everything! But what customers actually think: I already can't keep up with what I have. Or: How is this different from the other 50 publications I'm subscribed to? They're not excited about more content. They're often exhausted by the idea of it.](/images/posts/2025/you-don-t-want-more-content-conference-notes-issue-13-of-beyond-writing-code-1.jpg)](https://substack.com/@landonpoburan/p-166244806)

As [Macy Robison](https://macyrobison.com/) says: people don't pay for more information. We're all on information overload. **We pay for organization.**

_This is either information overload or heaven, not sure which.

I'm thinking about that not just in the context of this newsletter, but also for how I approach the book.

I don't want the book to be just an interesting thing to read. I want it to help.

Those of you who have worked with me may recognize this: I always want to know what to _do_. I want trainings with real-world application, step by step instructions to follow, and practical tips I can implement.

That's what I'd like in my book as well.

## Literature review in progress

In 2023, after having been a developer for more than 20 years, I attended my first ever tech conference.

It was DevOps Enterprise Summit, now called Enterprise Technology Leadership Summit. The host was Gene Kim, one of the authors of [The Phoenix Project](https://bookshop.org/a/114662/9781950508945). I had just read that book the year before, and it fundamentally shifted how I thought about our work as developers.

At the conference, I was surrounded by people who had been thinking deeply for years about how technology teams can work better. I collected a long reading list of books they considered essential.

Where was all this information when I was "growing up" as a developer?

I've been reading my way through a number of those books lately, especially those aimed at helping developers learn and grow.

One I wish I'd read earlier is [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://books.apple.com/us/audiobook/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition-2nd/id1492911629), by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt. (That's a link to the audiobook because wow, the hardcover is expensive!)

Thomas and Hunt do an excellent job of making practical suggestions as they go through their book. The book is much more technology-focused than mine will be, but I'm definitely inspired by their format.

I'll be at [Enterprise Technology Leadership Summit](https://itrevolution.com/product/enterprise-tech-leadership-summit-las-vegas/) again next month. I'm not speaking this year, as I did last year, but...

# Speaking at LeadDev StaffPlus

I am excited to be giving a lightning talk at the [LeadDev StaffPlus](https://leaddev.com/staffplus-new-york/) conference this year!

![Text: I'm speaking in New York. Leaf (Jessica) Roy; Developer, Architect, Author; Beyond Writing Code. StaffPlus New York, October 15-16, 2025. 15% off discount code: LEAF15](/images/posts/2025/you-don-t-want-more-content-conference-notes-issue-13-of-beyond-writing-code-3.jpg)

Speaking at LeadDev!

I'm apparently third on the agenda on the 15th, after two people who have written other [books I recommend](https://bookshop.org/lists/leaf-s-tech-books-list):

1.  Tanya Reilly will give the opening remarks. She's the author of [The Staff Engineer's Path](https://bookshop.org/a/114662/9781098118730), about what happens in the mysterious and often uncharted land beyond "senior developer."
2.  Then [Jez Humble](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/4149510.Jez_Humble), co-author of [Accelerate](https://bookshop.org/a/114662/9781942788331), a book I recommend (usually repeatedly) to anyone who wants to improve the performance of a technology organization.
3.  ...then me. No pressure or anything!

You can use the discount code **LEAF15** to get 15% off. Reach out to me first, though. I have one ticket for even cheaper.

I want to do a whole series for this newsletter based on the topic I'm going to be speaking about: "Us vs. Them" thinking. Perhaps starting next time.

# Other news

I'm also going to the [Grace Hopper Celebration](https://ghc.anitab.org/) in Chicago in November. I've heard about it for years, but I've never had the chance to go.

I'm currently taking a book proposal class as an add-on to the Book Academy program. That outline I sent you a few issues ago? Probably going to be completely overhauled. Each time, I'm getting closer to where I want to be!

# Drop me a note

I would love to hear from you. Hit reply and let me know what's on your mind.
