You’ve already got a full schedule when the boss asks you to take on a special project. Or maybe an urgent issue just jumped up above everything else you were planning to do this week. Or you’ve got multiple stakeholders, and all of them insist on being your “top priority”.

Before you start canceling evening and weekend plans so you can spend even more time than you already do at work: stop.

You only have so many hours in the week when you will be able to work effectively. And anyway, sacrificing your personal time might be necessary in a pinch, but it should be a rare occurrence. That time is yours!

When you start to see that you’ve got more on your plate than you can handle and still deliver the high quality of work you’d like to be known for, here are some strategies to find balance.

## Something else is de-prioritized

If you’ve got room for five projects in your week, and your manager just approached you with a sixth, inquire about which of the other five you should set aside to focus on the new project. It may be that when your manager realizes you have five important things already planned, that sixth one doesn’t seem so urgent after all. Or maybe they agree that #1 and #2 are still your top priorities, but #3 could wait for later, and this new project should take its place in your workload for the week.

## Someone else to the rescue

If none of your current projects can be dropped, perhaps there’s someone else who can assist with the new assignment. Or perhaps you can shift one of your items to someone else’s to do list in order to allow you to pick up the newcomer.

Be warned however that simply adding people is often not helpful. If a colleague is assigned to help you with one of your projects, but you are going to spend more time explaining the project to your colleague than you would spend just working on it yourself, this might not be the time-saver you expect. There are great reasons for working collaboratively, but short term time savings is not always one of them.

## Scale it back a bit

Let’s say you learn that all six of these projects must get done, and they must all get done by you. Can the scope of any of these projects be scaled back to allow you to handle all of them? Perhaps the columns on the table you’re coding don’t need a sort option, after all. Or maybe you can just handle the “happy path” case for the new screen, the error handling pieces can be taken care of next week.

## Step up now, step back later

In some situations, you might legitimately have a time crunch that can’t be avoided. There’s a hard deadline next week, and there’s nobody else available to pitch in. If that’s the case, you might choose to negotiate putting in some extra time now in exchange for a little extra time off after the deadline has passed — if you can trust that your management will keep that promise. A few late nights this week might be rough, but next week when you’re cutting out early on a sunny day or taking a morning off to relax, it might all be worth it.

## Estimating your work is part of your job

It isn’t easy to say “no” (or even “not this week”) to management or other stakeholders. However, accurately estimating how much time a project needs is part of your role. Your boss might not be aware that the “simple” item you are coding will take several days, or that you need several hours of preparation time for that workshop you are leading on Thursday.

For larger tasks, you might need to break it down into sub-estimates. Then, when your supervisor says “what do you mean that will take six weeks??” you can calmly explain how you arrived at that number to help them understand everything involved with the project. And again, if they say “but I need it done in three weeks,” you have options: drop other work, get some help, scale the project back, and so on.

Think of it as your manager _relying on you_, as a professional, to let them know how much time you will need to complete your work. This can help make it a little less intimidating to speak up when the boss arrives to add more to your already packed to do list. And finally, more good news: this gets easier with practice!
