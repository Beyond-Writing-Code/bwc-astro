“So, I put a lot of pressure on myself. All the time.”

My husband stared at me. “_Yes_,” he said emphatically, as if I’d just pointed out that ice is cold or nighttime is dark.

Okaaay, I guess the pressure I put on myself is a known fact here in our house. Not just for work or [writing](https://www.beyondwritingcode.com/book/), I mean for everything. Even on the weekends, lately, I feel pressured to make the best use of my time, get things done that aren’t work-related.

Sheesh, I just started taking a workshop to improve the quality of my sleep. And I can already feel myself ramping up to put pressure on myself to sleep better.

As if that will help.

Resistance is arising

Resistance is coming up a lot for me lately. I sit down in the morning on a weekday, intending to write.

Instead, my motivation to write goes completely out the window. The last thing I want to do is write.

So instead, I listen to an audio book. Or I [draw](https://www.beyondwritingcode.com/art/). Or I get sidetracked by something shiny. Anything but writing. Anything that isn’t on my giant to-do list.

Motivation then returns sometime later, when I’m planning to do something else. For example, it might show up after 8 pm on a Monday night, when I really ought to be doing some of those getting-ready-for-sleep practices. _\[looking at clock warily\]_

Well, what’s an efficient, organized, driven person to do when faced with this unwillingness to just get to work already? _Clearly_ I should figure out what’s blocking me and put even more pressure on myself to get past the block.

No. Turning up the pressure when I’m not getting stuff done sounds like it should work. But it absolutely doesn’t.

Why doesn’t pressure overcome resistance?

When I turn up the pressure, all I’m doing is pressing against the resistance that has come up. And when that resistance encounters pressure, does the pressure overcome the resistance? Does it just decide that my motivated self should prevail and yield?

Of course not. Instead, the resistance just increases. It’s getting pushed more, so it pushes back more.

The resistance is arising because the pressure is _too much._

How do I know? Because in moments like this, when there’s no pressure to write, the words just flow.

What helps, then?

I’m not sure what will help, honestly. But it isn’t turning up the pressure.

*   I’m thinking self-compassion is probably a good start.
*   Setting smaller goals for the day.
*   Acknowledging the things I’m getting done that aren’t writing.

After all, I didn’t quit my job only to write a book. I also intend to use the time to focus on my health and wellbeing: cooking more meals at home, getting outside for walks regularly, clearing my space of clutter, managing stress, and yes, sleeping better.

I’m definitely making progress in those areas.

Let’s see if taking some of the pressure off helps me return to the joy of writing, rather than pushing myself into the chore of writing.
