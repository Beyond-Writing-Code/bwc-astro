I’m looking forward to having more time to write in the next few months.

I have been to [three conferences](https://www.beyondwritingcode.com/2025/11/13/three-conferences-in-three-months/) in three months, including speaking at [LeadDev StaffPlus](https://www.beyondwritingcode.com/speaking-at-leaddev-staffplus/). It was so fun!

**Watch the video of my LeadDev StaffPlus talk here: [Us vs. them thinking](https://leaddev.com/communication/us-vs-them-thinking)**

You may need to make an account, so here are a few other great presentations from LeadDev (it’s hard to narrow it down to just three!)

- [Lessons from the other side: What your VP is actually thinking](https://leaddev.com/communication/lessons-from-the-other-side-what-your-vp-is-actually-thinking), by Kelly Moran
- [Leading sustainably while everything is on fire](https://leaddev.com/leadership/leading-sustainably-when-everything-is-on-fire), by Denise Yu
- [Anti-misalignment: Nobody knows what “alignment” is](https://leaddev.com/communication/anti-misalignment-nobody-knows-what-alignment-is), by Richard Kim

Now that I’m home, I’m glad to be back to focusing on writing.

Motivating me further: I just finished the book [The War of Art](https://bookshop.org/a/114662/9781936891023) by Steven Pressfield, which has been recommended to me so many times in the past few months that I was surprised to learn it was originally published in 2002. Good if you have a creative or entrepreneurial project and need a strong push to get to work already.

## Merging blog and newsletter

I’ve been debating whether or not to merge my newsletter and my blog. The fact that I feel like I should say “yes, I have both a newsletter and a blog for some reason, and they’re different,” is already a bad sign, isn’t it…

I had good intentions in splitting them into two:

- My **newsletter** was meant to be once-weekly content, delivered straight to your inbox. Subscribers only.

- Meanwhile, my **blog posts** were whenever-I-felt-like-it content, delivered to whoever was watching on Substack or Medium, or checking out my website. In any given week, I might post once, a few times, or not at all. They didn’t come to you by email unless you had Substack or Medium send them to you.

But the lines between email and blog are blurry. What content belongs where? And my writing was split into two places, only one of which was hosted on my website.

I was spending a lot of extra time each week managing content distribution. I’d rather spend the time creating content.

It just makes sense for me to merge them.

## Here’s the deal

Here’s how it will work going forward. I will publish all my long-form content on [my website](https://www.beyondwritingcode.com/posts/) first. Starting with this post 🙂

My newsletter is set up to watch my blog for new content.

Current [email subscribers](https://www.beyondwritingcode.com/newsletter/) will get a weekly digest on Thursday mornings, so it won’t look _too_ different, although I’m still figuring out how to make the formatting look good by email. If you’d rather get email for every post instead, let me know (or check your newsletter preferences).

New email subscribers will get an email for every post, with the option to switch to the digest.

The content will be duplicated on [LinkedIn](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/92u48nlr03unh694z6dh9hzod7d33hwhzmel8/kkhmh6hn675gp2ul/U3Vic2NyaWJlJTIwb24lMjBMaW5rZWRJbiUyMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpbmtlZGluLmNvbS9idWlsZC1yZWxhdGlvbi9uZXdzbGV0dGVyLWZvbGxvdz9lbnRpdHlVcm49NzM5NDEwNzE3NzcwMDk3MDQ5Nw==), [Substack](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/92u48nlr03unh694z6dh9hzod7d33hwhzmel8/25h2hoh3458rxof3/aHR0cHM6Ly9ib3VuY2luZ2xlYWYuc3Vic3RhY2suY29tLw==), and [Medium](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/92u48nlr03unh694z6dh9hzod7d33hwhzmel8/58hvh7hgkenpwzs6/aHR0cHM6Ly9ib3VuY2luZ2xlYWYubWVkaXVtLmNvbS8=), and linked on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/leafjessicaroy.bsky.social). (Facebook too, for now, but I’m not a fan and I may discontinue that at some point.)

Less time managing content distribution, more time to write.

Also, welcome to _\[checking current numbers…\]_ 170 subscribers so far who signed up this week on [LinkedIn](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/92u48nlr03unh694z6dh9hzod7d33hwhzmel8/kkhmh6hn675gp2ul/U3Vic2NyaWJlJTIwb24lMjBMaW5rZWRJbiUyMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpbmtlZGluLmNvbS9idWlsZC1yZWxhdGlvbi9uZXdzbGV0dGVyLWZvbGxvdz9lbnRpdHlVcm49NzM5NDEwNzE3NzcwMDk3MDQ5Nw==). Glad you’re here!
