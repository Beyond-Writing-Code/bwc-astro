## Comparison to Plan

The implementation follows the plan closely with some optimizations:

| Planned | Actual | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 20 hours | ~4 hours | Faster due to direct copying |
| React islands | ✅ | Header and KitForm |
| Content Collections | ✅ | With Zod validation |
| Post detail page | ✅ | Dynamic routing working |
| RSS feed | ✅ | At /feed.xml |
| Sitemap | ✅ | Auto-generated |
| Redirects | ✅ | In astro.config.mjs |

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to complete the full implementation:
1. Add remaining static pages (resume, terms, privacy)
2. Set up Playwright tests
3. Create GitHub Actions deployment workflow
4. Deploy to production hosting
5. Compare performance with Next.js version

## Problems Solved

✅ **Substack import broken images** - HTML contains images in source
✅ **LinkedIn copy/paste no images** - Images in actual HTML markup
✅ **Kit RSS feed broken images** - RSS contains real HTML with images
✅ **Medium import fails** - Page source has content, no JavaScript required

All content and images are now visible in the HTML source, making the site compatible with external tools and platforms.
